# Deep Learning Using Keras for Building Neural Networks

## Neural Network Configuration:

- **Hidden Layers**: Two hidden layers with:
  1. 64 neurons
  2. 32 neurons
- **Activation Function**: ReLU for hidden layers.
- **Output Layer**: 1 neuron (used for regression).
  - No activation function.
- **Loss Function**: Mean Squared Error (MSE).
- **Optimizer**: Adam.

## Notes:

This is a simple neural network. Depending on your specific use case and the complexity of your data, you may need a more complex network. Factors to consider include:

- Adding more layers.
- Incorporating different types of layers (e.g., convolutional or recurrent layers).
- Introducing dropout for regularization.

Moreover, it might be essential to tune the hyperparameters of your network for optimal performance. Approaches for tuning include:

- Manual tuning.
- Grid search.
- Randomized search.
