# Google Analytics with Scikit-learn

This repository contains a Python script that fetches data from Google Analytics, preprocesses the data, and then applies Scikit-learn's machine learning algorithms on it.

## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone [your-repository-url]
    cd [your-repository-name]
    ```

2. **Install Required Libraries**:
    ```bash
    pip install google-auth google-auth-httplib2 google-api-python-client pandas scikit-learn
    ```

3. **OAuth2 Credentials**:
    - Head over to [Google Developers Console](https://console.developers.google.com/).
    - Create a project and enable the Google Analytics API for it.
    - Create OAuth 2.0 client IDs.
    - Download the client secret JSON and place it in the project root. Rename it to `oauth2_credentials.json` (or update the script with your filename).

## Usage

1. Update the `YOUR_VIEW_ID` in the script with your actual Google Analytics view ID.
2. Run the script:
    ```bash
    python your_script_name.py
    ```

## Overview

- **Data Acquisition**: The script fetches data from Google Analytics, specifically sessions by date.

- **Data Preprocessing**: It then converts this data into a pandas DataFrame and preprocesses it for modeling.

- **Modeling**: The script uses a simple linear regression model from Scikit-learn to predict sessions based on the date.

## Note

This is a basic example and might need adjustments based on your specific needs, especially in data preprocessing, model selection, and evaluation.
