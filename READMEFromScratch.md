    Data loading and preprocessing: The script begins by loading a CSV dataset of handwritten digits from MNIST dataset. The dataset is converted to a numpy array and shuffled. It is then split into training and development sets. The pixel values of the images are normalized to range between 0 and 1.

    Model parameters initialization: The function init_params() initializes the weights and biases for the two layers of the neural network. The weights are initialized to small random values, and the biases are also initialized to small random values.

    Activation functions: The script defines two activation functions that the neural network uses: ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) for the hidden layer and softmax for the output layer.

    Forward propagation: The function forward_prop() defines the forward propagation step of the neural network, calculating the predicted outputs.

    Backward propagation and parameter updates: The script also defines the backpropagation step, where the gradients of the loss function with respect to the model's parameters are calculated. The parameters are then updated in the direction that minimally reduces the loss function.

    Training the model: The function gradient_descent() trains the model using the training data, applying forward propagation, backpropagation, and parameter updates for a given number of iterations.

    Model evaluation: The code includes functions to make predictions using the trained model (make_predictions()), and to evaluate the accuracy of these predictions (get_accuracy()).

    Prediction visualization: The function test_prediction() visualizes a prediction for a single image. It displays the image and prints the model's predicted digit and the true label.
